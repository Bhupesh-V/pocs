# Clone Variations

The script `clone-variations.sh` POCs different ways to clone a git repository, with the goal of finding the smallest resulting repository size.

## Usage

```bash
./clone-variations.sh https://repo-url
```

The script will take a loongish time to run, go listen to some music or something.
